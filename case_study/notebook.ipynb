    "**_The data sources used in this analysis consist of riding data provided by Motivate International Inc., a renowned bike-sharing services company. The data is securely stored on Amazon Web Service (AWS), a reputable and reliable cloud provider, ensuring accessibility and data integrity. The dataset is organized in comma-separated files with consistent naming conventions, except for September 2022. Each file contains the same number of columns with consistent names and appropriate data types, ensuring the data's coherence and structure. However, the analysis raises concerns about potential bias due to limited information on the data extraction process. On the positive side, the data represents the past 12 months and is collected in real-time through the company's app, bolstering its credibility and relevance. Nevertheless, the presence of missing values in the dataset may impact the accuracy of the resulting analysis. Additionally, privacy concerns have been addressed by altering riders' ID information to safeguard their identity and protect sensitive data. The data is licensed under Divvy, the bike-sharing company, and although the data is generally open-source, there are challenges related to its current accessibility due to server issues. For security purposes, copies of the original data files have been securely stored online using OneDrive._**"
